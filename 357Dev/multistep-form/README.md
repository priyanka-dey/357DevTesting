Things to still do with the form:
1. Get the projects in:
  a. we need to have the add button which will allow users to input their data
  b. needs to be a delete button
  c. needs to be an edit button 
2. figure out how to pass the projects array to the confirmation page 
3. figure out how to convert the projectd array to json format and add to the existing json object 
4. figure out how to calculate the default values
